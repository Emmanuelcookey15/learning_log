Learning Log is a Django web app that helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're learning about.


Basically what thiis app does is make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics you're learning about. 
Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.
